This is the project which I had developed during my internship at Emertxe Institute.
In this project, I have used PIC16F877A microcontroller and the development environment is PicSimlab(online simulator).
The simulation replicates the working of the real time oven with 4 main working modes: Start, Micro mode, Grill mode, Convection mode.
